# HR Insights Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

In today's hybrid world, understanding **how and where people work** is more important than ever. This Power BI project dives deep into **employee presence patterns**, work preferences, and leave behaviors to help HR and leadership teams make smarter, people-first decisions.

---

## Project Summary

This dashboard was created to **uncover trends in employee work styles**, such as:

- Who prefers working from home vs coming to the office?
- Are too many employees taking leave on the same day?
- Is there a rise in sick leaves?
- Are we scheduling key client releases when most of the team is actually available?

With data-driven answers to these questions, we can build a more **efficient, happy, and collaborative workplace**.

## What The Dashboard Reveals

ðŸ”¸ **Remote Work Rising**  
More employees are choosing to work from home. This insight opens the door to revisiting hybrid policies and improving virtual collaboration.

ðŸ”¸ **Presence Percentage Falling**  
A declining presence rate could affect team dynamics and delivery timelines. This trend acts as an early signal to plan better.

ðŸ”¸ **Unusual Leave Patterns**  
Frequent mass leaves on certain days? Something might be offâ€”low morale, unofficial holidays, or team burnout?

ðŸ”¸ **Sick Leave Spike**  
A consistent increase in sick leaves may indicate a need for wellness check-ins or mental health support.

ðŸ”¸ **Better Planning for Client Releases**  
Using presence data, we can forecast the best windows for important deployments when the team is most available.

ðŸ”¸ **Boosting Team Spirit**  
By analyzing WFH trends, we can spot the best opportunities to plan team-building activities or office meetups.
