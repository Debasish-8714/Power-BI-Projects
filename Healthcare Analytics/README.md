🏥 Healthcare Insights Dashboard

In a data driven healthcare environment, understanding cost patterns, resource utilization, and patient behavior is essential. This Power BI project dives into the financial performance of a healthcare center, offering meaningful insights for both operational efficiency and strategic planning.

Project Summary
This dashboard was created to analyze key healthcare metrics, including:

What is driving the total billing amount — city, procedure, or department?

Are insurance coverages aligning with actual treatment costs?

How long do patients typically stay, and how does it impact billing?

Which departments are contributing most to revenue?

With clear, data backed answers, stakeholders can optimize resource allocation, identify high performing areas, and improve patient care strategies.

What The Dashboard Reveals
🔹 City & Department wise Billing
Visual breakdowns show which cities and departments are generating the highest revenues - useful for expansion planning and service optimization.

🔹 Treatment & Medication Costs
Compare direct treatment costs with medication expenses to control budgeting more effectively.

🔹 Room Charge Utilization
By calculating room charges based on length of stay, hospitals can assess operational costs and improve pricing models.

🔹 Insurance vs Out-of-Pocket
Gauge how much is being covered by insurance and how much patients are paying directly — helping improve financial assistance programs.

🔹 Patient Satisfaction Metrics
Track average satisfaction scores alongside billing and stay data to understand the full patient experience.

🔹 Procedure & Department Contribution %
Identify top performing procedures and departments in terms of revenue and patient volume.
